For my learning outcomes however, I am obligated to explore a model based approach. MCTS is my approach of choice. My plan is to implement the transition model as a tree and use MCTS to search through the tree to find the best move.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems to me that building a transition model (i.e. using a model based approach) is most viable when it is easy (i.e. wont take to long) to exhaustively turn all the rules and actions of a problem into code. For example, chess has pretty simple and relativly small set of rules. Their are only so many moves a piece can make, and their are not that many pieces. They have very predictable behavior, which makes it easy to implement a transition model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pokemon on the other hand, has 493 pieces and 215 unique move effects. Not to mention the fact that:\n",
    "-  a trainer can have items to its disposale. \n",
    "-  the battle field can vary in state (i.e. weather, terrain, etc)\n",
    "-  the battle field can have different rules (i.e. double battle, triple battle, etc)\n",
    "-  pokemons can level up and learn new moves\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it very hard to implement a complete transition model for pokemon. Utilizing other peoples work (like for example, using the effect methods from `poke_battle_sim.util.process_move`) could make implementing a complete transition model easier. But given the time constraints of this project, I do not have the time to implement a complete transition model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then their is the issue that model based approaches are more memory exhaustive, as storing large rollouts of the transition model can take up a lot of memory. This problem could be negated by utilizing smart usage of persistant storage to for examle store explored states and retrieving those. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transition models also seem more explanitory, as it is more clear how for example MCTS evaluates a path then when using a DQN for example. The evaluation of a MCTS is also more deterministic then a DQN, as the DQN uses a neural network to approximate the value of a state.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model based approach also requires less iterations to converge then a model free approach. This is because a model based approach can use the transition model to evaluate a path, while a model free approach has to rely on random exploration to converge towards a optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude with a comparison between model-based and model-free approaches:\n",
    "> A model based approach is most viable when a problem has simple rules and pieces at play (like with chess), as that would make it easier to implement a complete transition model.   \n",
    "> If the problem has complex rules and pieces at play and a implementation is already provided (like with pokemon or other games), a model free approach is more viable."
