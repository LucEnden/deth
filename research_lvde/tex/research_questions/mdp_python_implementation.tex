\section{How can Markovian decision processes be implemented in Python?}

In this chapter we will look at how \gls{mdp}'s can be implemented in python.

\subsection{What are Markovian decision processes?}

For a more formal definition, please see ... TODO: insert inner document href to formal definition

TODO: describe in your own words what MDP's are, its relation towards reinforcement learning, using the book and slides to gather info

\subsection{What tools, libraries, or frameworks are available to assist in programming Markovian decision processes?}

TODO: desribe the list bellow in a more 

- Fundementals like: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
    For data manipulation, visualization, etc.
- https://keras.io/examples/rl/ with https://pytorch.org/
    For custom deep reinforcement learning approaches. 
    Given my previous experience with pytorch powered keras models the choice for using this combination of libraries is self evident to me.
- https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/
    For pre-built reinforcement learning models. 
    Given the fact that I am not yet familiar with the inner workings of reinforcement learning, using pre-built models is a good way to get started.
    In future experiments, once I have a better understanding of the inner workings of reinforcement learning, I can start building my own models using the tools above.

    Given its one of if not the most populair RL projects out there, it is a good starting point for me to get familiar with the concepts of RL.
