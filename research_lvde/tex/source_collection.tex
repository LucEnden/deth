\section{On Source Collection}

This study relies heavily on community-driven documentation as a primary source of information about the mechanics of Pok√©mon Platinum. Community resources, such as fan-maintained wikis, forums, and reverse-engineering projects, often provide detailed insights that are not readily available in official publications. To ensure the reliability of these sources, all community-provided information will be cross-referenced and validated against independent findings where possible.

In addition to community-driven resources, this study also incorporates purely academic sources. These sources include textbooks, journal articles, and other scholarly works that provide the theoretical foundation for the models and methods used in the research. By combining community-based documentation with rigorous academic literature, this study aims to achieve a balance between practical insights and theoretical soundness.
