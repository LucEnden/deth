\chapter{Research Questions}

To complement the goal of creating a probabilistic model that plays Pokémon Platinum, I devised some research questions to guide me toward a viable solution.

These questions aim to provide a structured framework for addressing the theoretical and practical challenges involved in creating a probabilistic model for gameplay. They span foundational research, technical implementation, and performance optimization, ensuring a comprehensive approach to the study.

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{What are popular (both old and new) reinforcement learning approaches?}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item How do these approaches compare in terms of their strengths and weaknesses?
%         \item Are there supporting methods, such as statistical techniques or others, that could enhance the effectiveness of reinforcement learning?
%     \end{itemize}

%     \item \textbf{How can Markovian decision processes be implemented in Python?}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item What tools, libraries, or frameworks are available to assist in programming Markovian decision processes?
%     \end{itemize}

%     \item \textbf{How can we efficiently simulate Pokémon Platinum?}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item What does "efficiency" entail in this context, particularly regarding time and computational complexity (and potentially space complexity)?
%         \item What existing software products or tools are available for this purpose, and how can they be utilized or adapted?
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{enumerate}
