\chapter{Research Questions}

To complement the goal of creating a probabilistic model that plays Pok√©mon Platinum, I devised some research questions to guide me toward a viable solution.

These questions aim to provide a structured framework for addressing the theoretical and practical challenges involved in creating a probabilistic model for gameplay. They span foundational research, technical implementation, and performance optimization, ensuring a comprehensive approach to the study.
