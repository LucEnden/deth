\subsection{Fundemental Action Space}

The \emph{Fundemental Action Space} $A$ is a constant 13-tuple containing the following strings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A_{0}$  = none
    \item $A_{1}$  = up
    \item $A_{2}$  = down
    \item $A_{3}$  = left
    \item $A_{4}$  = right
    \item $A_{5}$  = a
    \item $A_{6}$  = b
    \item $A_{7}$  = x
    \item $A_{8}$  = y
    \item $A_{9}$  = l
    \item $A_{10}$ = r
    \item $A_{11}$ = start
    \item $A_{12}$ = select
\end{itemize}

The actions are essentially all the I/O inputs on the device where pokemon platinum was designed to be played on, which is the Nintento DS.

\subsection{Derived Action Space}

TODO: describe that a more meaningfull action space can be made from each of the fundemental action space at any state s. the more meaningfull action space includes 3 actions:
- use move
- switch pokemon
- use item

Where each action $a(s) => \{ x; x \in A \}$
