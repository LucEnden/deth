In this mini project you are going to demonstrate your understanding of Decision Theory by:
- Calculating Optimal Actions using Utility Theory
and
- Calculating an Optimal Policy for a Markovian Decision process

Requirements:
- You program a Stochastic Environment with a non-trivial task in a Jupyter Notebook.
- (Examples of such environments can be found in Jupyter Notebooks DETH Sample Environments.)
- The behavior of the Agent is programmed from scratch based on the theory of this course.
- You show you can optimize an agent task based on a given Utility Function/Additive Reward.
- You show that you can analyze the performance of the calculated solutions.
- You show that you can compare and reason about alternative solution methods. 

Process:
- You document your findings in markdown in the Jupyter Notebook
- (the only submissions allowed are single .ipynb files).
- You are encouraged to submit intermediate versions to get early feedback from your teacher.
- Two mandatory submit points have been defined.
- This is a duo assignment (if you go solo, please also register in a project group 'deth project duo').
